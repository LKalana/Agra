# Agra: Agricultural Intelligence System 🌾🚜

Agra is an Agricultural Intelligence System designed to assist farmers in cultivating crops efficiently. The system comprises three phases: AgraMu, AgraEx, and AgraDNN.

## AgraMu - Micro Utility IoT Environment 🌱

AgraMu focuses on collecting sensor data from the agricultural environment and providing real-time insights to farmers through web and mobile applications.

### Project Structure 📁

- `AgraMu/`: Directory for AgraMu components.
  - `app.py`: Flask application for AgraMu.
  - `templates/`: Folder containing HTML templates.
    - `index.html`: HTML template for displaying sensor data.

### Getting Started 🚀

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/LKalana/Agra.git`
2. Navigate to the AgraMu directory: `cd Agra/AgraMu`
3. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
4. Run the Flask app: `python app.py`
5. Access the app in your browser: `http://localhost:5000/`

### Dependencies 🛠️

- Flask
